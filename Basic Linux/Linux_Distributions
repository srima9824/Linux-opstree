Microsoft combines all the bits of Windows internally to produce each new release of Windows and distributes it as a single package. 
If you want Windows, you’ll need to choose one of the versions Microsoft is offering.

But Linux is an open source software.The Linux operating system isn’t produced by a single organization. Different organizations and 
people work on different parts. There’s the Linux kernel (the core of the operating system), the GNU shell utilities (the terminal 
interface and many of the commands you use), the X server (which produces a graphical desktop), the desktop environment (which runs on the X
server to provide a graphical desktop), and more. System services, graphical programs, terminal commands – many are developed independently
from another. They’re all open-source software distributed in source code form.

If you wanted to, you could grab the source code for the Linux kernel, GNU shell utilities, Xorg X server, and every other program on 
a Linux system, assembling it all yourself. However, compiling the software would take a lot of time – not to mention the work involved 
with making all the different programs work properly together.

Most distributions add their own finishing touches, such as themes and custom software – the Unity desktop environment 
Ubuntu provides, for example.
Example:
Fedora
RedHat
Ubuntu
CentOS
Debian
Slackware etc..

WHAT IS A SHELL?
A shell is a program that provides an interface between a user and an operating system (OS) kernel. 
An OS starts a shell for each user when the user logs in or opens a terminal or console window.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHELL AND BASH:
"Shell" is a program, which facilitates the interaction between the user and operating system (kernel). There are many shells available, 
like sh, bash, csh, zsh...etc."Bash shell" scripting is, a kind of shell scripting only. You can say, its a subset of "shell" scripting.
